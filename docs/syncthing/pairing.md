<p>Leave it default unless you know what you're doing
</div>
<br>

5. Let Syncthing restart after first setup. usually it'll download latest library

<div align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/LPMDMHz/syncthing-first-run-005.png" alt="Animegrimoire Syncthing Setup" height="280" width="650"</img>
</div>
<br>

6. Copy your Syncthing ID in Settings `->` Show ID

<div align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/QHv8qcB/syncthing-first-run-006.png" alt="Animegrimoire Syncthing Setup" height="280" width="650"</img>
<br><br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/z7QVvTg/syncthing-first-run-007.png" alt="Animegrimoire Syncthing Setup" height="280" width="650"</img>
</div>
<br>

7. Ask in [discord](https://discord.gg/HubPERS) to have your ID paired

<div align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/L9k0405/syncthing-pairing-00.png" alt="Animegrimoire Syncthing Setup" height="140" width="525"</img>
<br>This is a bad example
</div>
<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/0JJH80y/syncthing-pairing-01.png" alt="Animegrimoire Syncthing Setup" height="123" width="525"</img>
<br>This is a good example
</div>
<br>

You also need to Specify which anime Title are you interested on.<br>
Animegrimoire splits the syncthing folder into few categories:

**Global** : This category will give you `everything` that available in our server<br>
**Ongoing** : This category will give your all currently `Ongoing` releases<br>
**Completed**  : This category will give you completed release (usually `BD Release`) but encoded in current season<br>
**Unindexed** : This category will give you unspecified group that encoded in current season (usually from `Request`, `OVAs` and `Movies`)

For other choice, you may also specify the anime title such as `Azur Lane`, `Attack on Titan Season 2`, `Mahouka Movie` .etc

8. Wait until someone with `@Aurora` role confirmed your request

<div align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/rHCHRBx/syncthing-pairing-02.png" alt="Animegrimoire Syncthing Setup" height="170" width="525"</img>
<br>That's what you got for asking random folder
</div>
<br>

9. Accept animegrimoire's Syncthing "Physis" in your client

<div align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/HYMzn8v/physis-01.png" alt="Animegrimoire Syncthing Setup" height="225" width="650"</img>
</div>
<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/CznDJ1N/physis-02.png" alt="Animegrimoire Syncthing Setup" height="450" width="650"</img>
<br>You don't have to check anything on Shared Folders
</div>
<br>

10. Wait until your desired folder is connected to your device

<div align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/pwgNVxy/physis-03.png" alt="Animegrimoire Syncthing Setup" height="340" width="650"</img>
<br>Once it shown, click [Add]
</div>
<br>

11. Setup your download folders

<div align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/gjTYNtx/physis-04.png" alt="Animegrimoire Syncthing Setup" height="432" width="650"</img>
<br>be careful when to decide your download folder, and then click Save
</div>
<br>

Please be careful when you decide your download folder because;
- It's hard to `move`

Once you already decided to place it in one place, it's hard to move it unless you willing to re-download everything. You may also move it, and then overwrite your syncthing with old files, but it'll cause some errors in Syncthing. please consult to `@Aurora` if you need help.
<br>Some considerations to pick the best download place are *where you easily access it* and *where the disk won't be full until the anime is finish airing*

- If you `move` your download folder, syncthing will redownload it again

as I stated above Syncthing will redownload everything again, causeing duplicate files in your local storage which might be undesirable for you.

12. Sit and wait while Sycnthing download files for you

There might be frequent disconnect especially if your connections are slow. But don't worry because it'll reconnect automatically. We tested this in 30KBps-100KBps speed to 1Gbps speed, it works fine even in slow connections.

If you got any question, don't hesitate to ask in our discord. We'll try to help and it might also help us to build this wiki. Even if you can't understand anything about syncthing and still want to get our releases, we'll help you using remote desktop.
