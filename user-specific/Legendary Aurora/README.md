# Epilogue

   Animegrimoire.org is Cyber12's successor where we provide low-sized anime. It was never a High-quality 4:4:4 10bit FLAC autism on steroids provider. If anyone ever asked why you uses bitstarved 550kbps video 32kbps he-aac audio instead doing full-bd standard, lead those lost lamb to get better reading comprehension. 

   We are here because we care for low-end segment where people just download anime and enjoy it without bothering too much about visual quality. May in rare chance there's someone feeling guilty for keep downloading stuff for free, lead them to purchase respective mentioned anime whether it's a figures, bd, merchandise or anything that related to them to keep anime industry stay alive.

>  *Once upon a time there's a fool that loves quick download stuff for free and simply be happy while watching it. I were once *that* fool. Now we are returning the favor to make anyone else to be happy like we once did. May our time is well-spent, may our money is used for better progression and everyone is happy.* *-* [*libev10.*](https://t.me/libev10)
